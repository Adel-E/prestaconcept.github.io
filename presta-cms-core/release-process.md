# PrestaCMS Realease process


As PrestaCMS is based on SymfonyCMF which has already a really [great release process][1], we will take it as
a reference.

Please register to our [google group][3] to be aware of new PrestaCMS release and new features.

Take a look at the [Symfony CMF Release Process][1].

See the core documentation for the [core Symfony release process][2].
