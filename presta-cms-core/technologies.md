# Technologies used


## Symfony2

PrestaCMS is a bundle for the great [Symfony2 PHP Framework][1].

So it will easily fit in your 2.2 or upper Symfony2 version projects.


## SymfonyCMF

PrestaCMS based all his content management on [SymfonyCMF][2] which is an open source project supported by a great community.

Official CMF documentation can be found on [symfony.com][3].

So all CMF features will be available in PrestaCMS.


## Sonata-Project

PrestaCMS based all its administration system on [Sonata-Project][4] which have some of the most used Symfony2 bundles.

It's well documented and have a great community behind.

## AngularJS

To enhance our admin interface we integrated [AngularJS][5] which is a JavaScript MVW Framework.


## Continuous integration / Code quality

Here at PrestaConcept we do our best to make quality. That why PrestaCMS is plugged on [Travis][6] for continuous integration.

Code is tested with [PHPUnit][7], the [CMF testing component][8] and soon [Behat][9] for the administration interface.

Code is parsed with PHPCodeSniffer on PSR2.

And as any serious Symfony2 bundle we use [SensioLabsInsight][10] too !
