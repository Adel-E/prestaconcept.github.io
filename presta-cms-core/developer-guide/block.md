#Block System

## Overview

PrestaCms content in managed trought blocks. Every pages and theme are divided in zones which contains blocks of different types.

Block system in based on [CMFBlockBundle][1] which extends [SonataBlockBundle][2].

Before going further, we suggest you read the [SonataBlockBundle][2] documentation which explain a lot of useful step.


## Block types

PrestaCMSCore handle basic block types :

-   Simple : A simple block contains a title, a text, a link to another CMS page.

Multiple format are available : 50/50, 1/3 - 2/3.... Containers can contain any kind of other blocks.

-   Page children : this blocks display a list of page children with a title and a description. It is usually used for
step pages

Other bundle can easily add more block types to your application, for example you can have a look at [PrestaCMSMediaBundle][5]
which adds different blocks to render medias.


##Â Block base service

If you have read the [SonataBlockBundle][2] documentation you should now that two main elements of a block are a template
and a service class responsible of rendering the block.

Common block features have been centralized in [BaseBlockService][3] so every new block service should extend it.

[BaseBlockService][3] commons features are :


-   provide the **translator**
-   automatically load the **template**
-   **preview** : block which used javascript or complex css features to render should provide a preview image to display it
in the administration screen. For example a carousel.
-   **settingsRoute** : block which displays application entities (for example blog posts) should provide a settingsRoute which
is the sonata admin code of the entities listing.
A link to the corresponding admin listing will be displayed in the page administration.
