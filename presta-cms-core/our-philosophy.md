# Our philosophy

PrestaCMSCore has been by professionals for professionals web developers.
Our goal is to provided a CMS layer for Symfony2 projects.

Even if it will be a good choice for content websites, you will really appreciate its power
when you will have to code real world features and integrate it in your site content.

Before digging into PrestaCMSCore code, you should be comfortable with Symfony2 and have a look
at Symfony CMF and Sonata-project.

As we decide to release it to the community as an open source project, we will pay attention to
to your feedbacks. So feel free to use it, hack it, extend it... and help us make it better.
